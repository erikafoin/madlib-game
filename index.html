    <h1>Wacky MadLib</h1>
    <body>
        Once upon a time there was a <span id="mammal"></span> that loved <span id="noun-1"></span>. All day long she searched <span id="place"></span> for more <span id="noun-1"></span> but there were just never enough for her <span id="adjective-1"></span>
        <br>
        After a long time of <span id="adverb"></span> around <span id="place"></span>, the <span id="adjective-2"></span> <span id="mammal"></span> was <span id="emotion"></span>. So she threw herself off a <span id="geological-formation"></span> and perished. 
        <br>
        The end.
